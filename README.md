Data Science Finding Data Course Project

run_analysis.R reads several data sets downloaded in a Zip file from the Human Acitvity Recognition project site at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

To replicate the dataset, set the working directory to the top-level directioy of the un-Zipped download file. The script looks for some small files in tis directory, and for the main and other data files in the /test and /trial subdirectories created when the download is un-Zipped. 

This first scrript only performs steps 1-4 of the course project assignment. 

A second script, not compelted, produced the tabulated averages of all "mean" and "STD" variables, by Activity and Subject.
