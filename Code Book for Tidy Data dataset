This Code Book describes the dataset produced by running the run_analysis.R script against several files in the un-Zipped 
directories downloaded from: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Additional documentation of the project that produced the data is at:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The un-Zipped file contains descriptive information on the input data.  

This analysis does NOT use all files in the downloaded Zip archive. Notably, no use is made of any files in the 
"Inertial Signals" sub-sub-directories of the /train and /test sub-directories.

NOTE: the working directory when the run_analysis.R script is executed must be the top-level directory created by 
un-Zipping the downlaod file.  The directory is "UCI HAR Dataset". 

This analysis can be broken down into two parts:

1.  Combine the main data sets containing observation data with the smaller files containing classification variables. 
This adds the Subject and Activity variables to the corresponding "mean" and "standard deviation" observation variables.
Two main datasets (X_train.txt and X_test.text) are then joined vertically (they have the same columnns: the two sets 
of rows are joined to produce one dataset with rows equalt to the sume of the train and test datasets. Finally, the dataset
reduced by selecting out only the "mean" and "std deviationn" variables needed for this analysis.

2.  The script next creates a data frame and, optionally, a .txt file with arithmetic means of observation data 
summarized by Measure, Activity and Subject.

Dataset description:

Description of the R data frame produced is as follows.  

	11880 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ Measure        : Factor w/ 66 levels "tBodyAcc.mean...X",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ Subject        : num  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
 $ Activity       : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ Arithmetic Mean: num  0.277 0.276 0.276 0.279 0.278 ...

A fuller explanation of the numeric observational variables (Measure) 
is in the "UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt" file in the downloaded Zip file.

The Activity variable codes are interpreted as follows:
Code	Activity Description
1     WALKING
2     WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3     WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4     SITTING
5     STANDING
6     LAYING

Tne Subject codes refer to the 30 individuals participating in the data-creation activities.  
They are not further identified. 

The .txt file was produced from the data frame by: write.table("data frame name", "TidyHARMeans.txt", row.names=F)

The columns (variables) are space-separated; variable names are included and are as shown above in the data frame 
description.
